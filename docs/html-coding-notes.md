# Basic HTML

## HTML Tags

Every HTML file uses tags. See the following table

Tag | Use
`<!DOCTYPE html>` | To indicate that a file is written in HTML, begin every HTML doc with this tag

`<html>` | Open HTML command
`</html>` | Close HTML command. Nest commands so that they close in the reverse order from which they were opened
`head` `/head`| Includes information about the file including the page title
`title` `/title` | Page title
`<body>` `</body>`| Body tags open and close information to be included in the web page
`<a href="http://www.catherinelush.com">Where I learn to code!</a>` | Open a tag, insert a link, close the tag
`<img src="http://bit.ly/RhrMEn" />` | Insert an image
`<a href="http://www.catherinelush.com"> img src="http://bit.ly/RhrMEn" />`
